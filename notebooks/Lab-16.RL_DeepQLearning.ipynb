The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over by increasing and reducing the cart's velocity.\n","\n","\n","#### Action space\n","Breakout has the action space `Discrete(2)` with the table below lists the meaning of each action's meanings. \n","\n","- 1: Left\n","- 2: Right\n","\n","\n","#### Observations\n","By default, the environment returns the RGB image that is displayed to human players as an observation.\n","\n","#### Rewards\n","In this task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep. This means better performing scenarios will run for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n","\n","#### Episode termination\n","* Pole Angle is more than 12 degrees\n","* Cart Position is more than 2.4 (center of the cart reaches the edge of the display)\n","* Episode length is greater than 500, or another value set by the variable *env.\\_max\\_episode\\_steps*\n","\n","#### State space\n","\n","At each game frame, the game engine provides information of the state. This state is then used to compute the features the agent will use. \n","\n","As starting state, all observations are assigned a uniformly random value in $(-0.05, 0.05)$.\n","\n","The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values representing the environment state `(cart position, cart velocity, pole position, pole velocity)`. We take these 4 inputs without any scaling and pass them through a small fully-connected network with 2 outputs, one for each action. \n","\n","\n","## Implementation\n","First, let's install the version of Gymnasium containing this environment.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4NqOGKPh8kpR"},"id":"4NqOGKPh8kpR"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%capture\n","!pip install

illustrated below.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-16-at-5.46.01-PM.png\" alt= “” width=\"700\">\n","\n","Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted, cumulative reward \n","$$R_{t_0} = \\sum_{t=t_0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{t - t_0} r_t$$\n","where $R_{t_0}$ is also known as the *reward*.  \n","The discount, $\\gamma$, should be a constant between $0$ and $1$ that ensures the sum converges. A lower $\\gamma$ makes rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent than the ones in the near future, of which it can be fairly confident \n","about. It also encourages agents to collect reward closer in time than equivalent rewards that are temporally far away in the future.\n","\n","The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function $Q^*: State \\times Action \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, that could tell\n","us what our return would be, and if we were to take an action in a given state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our rewards:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\!\\max_a \\ Q^*(s, a)\\end{align}\n","\n","However, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have access to $Q^*$. But, since **neural networks are universal function approximators**, we can simply create one and train it to resemble $Q^*$.\n","\n","For our training update rule, we'll use the fact that every $Q$ function for some policy obeys the Bellman equation:\n","\n","\\begin{align}Q^{\\pi}(s, a) = r + \\gamma \\, Q^{\\pi}(s', \\pi(s'))\\end{align}\n","\n","The difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the **temporal difference error**, $\\delta$:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \\gamma \\, \\max_a' Q(s', a))\\end{align}\n","\n","To minimize this error, we will use the [Huber loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss). The Huber loss acts\n","like the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean absolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to outliers when the estimates of $Q$ are very noisy. We calculate this over a batch of transitions, $B$, sampled from the replay memory:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{|B|}\\sum_{(s, a, s', r) \\ \\in \\ B} \\mathcal{L}(\\delta)\\end{align}\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\text{where} \\quad \\mathcal{L}(\\delta) = \\begin{cases}\n","     \\frac{1}{2}{\\delta^2}  & \\text{for } |\\delta| \\le 1, \\\\\n","     |\\delta| - \\frac{1}{2} & \\text{otherwise.}\n","   \\end{cases}\\end{align}\n","Our model will be a feed forward  neural network that takes in the difference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two outputs, representing $Q(s, \\mathrm{left})$ and $Q(s, \\mathrm{right})$ (where $s$ is the input to the network). In effect, the network is trying to predict the *expected return* of taking each action given the current input.\n","\n","\n","### Two networks\n","\n","In deep Q-learning, there are two main components: the policy network (also known as the Q-network or online network) and the target network. These two networks serve different purposes and play specific roles in the learning process.\n","\n","1. Policy Network:\n","   - The policy network is responsible for approximating the action-value function (Q-function) in Q-learning.\n","   - It takes the current state as input and outputs the estimated Q-values for all possible actions.\n","   - The policy network is updated during training by minimising the difference between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values.\n","   - The updates to the policy network are driven by the temporal difference (TD) error.\n","   - The policy network is updated after each step or episode to continually improve its Q-value predictions.\n","\n","2. Target Network:\n","   - The target network is a separate copy of the policy network that is used as a stable target for estimating the target Q-values during training.\n","   - The target network's parameters are not updated during the training process. Instead, they are updated periodically with a [soft update](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf) controlled by the hyperparameter $\\tau$. This is method of gradually updating the parameters of the target network from the parameters of the policy network by blending the parameters of the target network with the parameters of the policy network using a weighted average.\n","   - The purpose of the target network is to provide a more stable and reliable target for training the policy network.\n","   - By using a separate target network, it helps to mitigate the issue of the Q-value estimates being influenced by their own updates, which can lead to instability or divergence during training."],"metadata":{"id":"jz_42J0xBCPa"},"id":"jz_42J0xBCPa"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")"],"metadata":{"id":"bK06wpbsBJhO"},"id":"bK06wpbsBJhO","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class DQN(nn.Module):\n","\n","    def __init__(self, n_observations, n_actions):\n","        super(DQN, self).__init__()\n","        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(n_observations, 128)\n","        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(128, 128)\n","        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(128, n_actions)\n","\n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        x = F.relu(self.layer1(x))\n","        x = F.relu(self.layer2(x))\n","        return self.layer3(x)"],"metadata":{"id":"Rz5OUMd5Famn"},"id":"Rz5OUMd5Famn","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Replay Memory\n","\n","We'll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN.
